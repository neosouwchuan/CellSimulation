# CellSimulation
My 15 hour attempt at scell simulation at 17, meaning I have to refactor it
As of 27/10/2024, I originally intended to write a Unity2D Reinforcement Learning project as the next step, which is half done, however I have an internship for 6 months next year which coicindentally is in the same type of reinforcment learning, so this is on hold to avoid repetition.
Will publish future work if it can be made public.
